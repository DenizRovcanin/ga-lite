# ga-lite
> Small, cacheable subset of Google Analytics JS client

This project is a non-official client for [Google Analytics API][ga-api].

## Install to your project

TODO: Write this

At least:
```html
<script>
var galite = galite ||Â {};
galite.UA = 'UA-XXXXXX'; // Insert your tracking code here
</script>
```

## Developing

Install the project by running:
```shell
npm install
```

### Building

This plugin requires Grunt Command-line interface ```grunt-cli```

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out
the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains
how to install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process,
you may compile this project with this command:

```shell
grunt
```

Once the compilation has ended, Grunt has compiled the assets from `/src` folder
to `/dest` folder.

## Features

At this point the plugin sends the GA `pageview` event to the Google Analytics
server on page unload.

### Known bugs

Since the beacon is sent on unload, this will most certainly mess up your GA's
page timing (avg. time on site etc).

Also this library does not (yet) track page load times or support sending custom
events.

## Contributing

As stated above, the library is still quite barebone. If you'd like to request a
feature, please [open an issue][issues].

If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository and use a feature branch.
Pull requests are warmly welcome.

### Motivation

This project was born, because it is currently impossible to use Google Analytics'
official JS library to track your site if you want to achieve 100/100 in Google
PageSpeed Insights.

This happens, because Google Analytics' official JS library is has a cache header
of the length of 2 hours. As PageSpeed Insights forces longer cache times, a
custom GA library is practically the only way to achieve 100/100 points.

This project also makes it possible to:
* Your site to load faster (as this is smaller lib than the official)
* Be sure your site won't serve any code you can't check yourself
