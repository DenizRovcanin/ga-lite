# ga-lite
> Small, cacheable subset of Google Analytics JS client

This project is a non-official client for [Google Analytics API][ga-api].

## Install to your project

You can install ga-lite to your project by adding the following code to the ended
of your HTML `<body>`:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/ga-lite/latest/ga-lite.min.js" async></script>
<script>
var galite = galite ||Â {};
galite.UA = 'UA-XXXXXX'; // Insert your tracking code here
</script>
```

This includes the most recent version of ga-lite to your site and initializes
the script with your own UA code.

## Developing

Install the project by running:

```shell
npm install
```

This installs the needed dependencies for this project.

### Building

You can compile this project with npm command:

```shell
npm run build
```

Once the compilation has ended, Grunt has compiled the assets from `/src` folder
to `/dest` folder.

Do not add the `dest/` folder files manually to your pull request. The deploy is
done automatically.

### Deploying

The deploy is done automatically by Travis. Creating a new release is done with
the following npm command:

```shell
npm run deploy
```

This command will ask for new version number and it will create the build commit
and tag for you automatically.

You'll need to push the tag and commit to git manually.

## Features

At this point the plugin sends the GA `pageview` event to the Google Analytics
server on page load and other custom `unload` event on page unload.

Unload event is used so the GA would track the average time spent on page
better.

## Configuration

#### UA
Type: `String`  
Required: `true`

The UA code from your [Google Analytics admin panel][ua-code-howto].

Example:
```javascript
var galite = galite || {};
galite.UA = 'UA-123456';
```

#### anonymizeIp
Type: `Boolean`  
Default: `false`

Sets the [aip flag][aip-flag] that advices GA to
[anonymize the IP address][anonymize-ip-address].

Example:
```javascript
var galite = galite || {};
galite.UA = 'UA-XXXXXX'; // Insert your tracking code here
galite.anonymizeIp = true;
```

## Contributing

This library is still quite barebone. If you'd like to request a feature,
please [open an issue][issues].

If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository and use a feature
branch. Pull requests are warmly welcome.

Note: Do not add the `dist/` folder files to your pull request, as the master
branch should have the most up-to-date version's build files included. The
new versions will be automatically fetched by `jsdelivr` to the CDN.

### Motivation

This project was born, because it is currently impossible to use Google
Analytics' official JS library to track your site if you want to achieve 100/100
in Google PageSpeed Insights.

This happens, because Google Analytics' official JS library is has a cache
header of the length of 2 hours. As PageSpeed Insights forces longer cache
times, a custom GA library is practically the only way to achieve 100/100 points.

This project also makes it possible to:
* Your site to load faster (as this is smaller lib than the official)
* Be sure your site won't serve any code you can't check yourself

You can read more from the [blog post][blog-post] that's written about the
library.
